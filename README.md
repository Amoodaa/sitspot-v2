# SitSpot

## Problem
- People love traveling independently
- People are making ethical choices in food, fashion
- People want to bring travel in line with their sustainable values
- **Travellers lack resources to make informed environment-friendly choices**

## Solution
A website that lets the users find and add reviews on places they have visited, and rating them based on a few questionnaires that we designed to help us determine the sustainability factors and key features of places!

## User journey
**Travellers open the website to search for places that they can travel to while seeing their sustainability factor, which will help them feel good about their travel choices.**
