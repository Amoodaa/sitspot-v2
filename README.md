# SitSpot

## Problem
- People love travelling independently
- People are making ethical choices in food, fashion
- People want to bring travel in line with their sustainable values
- **Travellers lack resources to make informed enviroment friendly choices**

## Solution
A website that lets the users find and add reviews on places they have visited, and rating them based on few questionnaires that we designed to help us determine the sustainabilty factors and key features of places!

## User journey
**Travellers open the website to search for places that they can travel to, while seeing their sustainabilty factor, which will help them feel good about their travel choices.**
